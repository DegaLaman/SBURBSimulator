He wears a green tuxedo and tophat with a dollar sign on it at all times, which hides his hair, If the tophat gets knocked off he gets angery. His origin was from a normal session, where his quest was to collect as much boondollars as possible in a short time frame and then give it away. Unfortunately he didn’t give it away, and left the session by buying a spaceship and searching for more boonies and people like him. Soon, his thoughts became malicious, and he wanted to kill and rob other people, so he started raiding sessions. He attacks using briefcases, and he and his fellow employees can use “Steam Sales”, which rains Steam Sales. The Ultimate Sale Thief can use a powerful version, “Tsunami of Sales”. He whacks people with his briefcase, and his guards use spears. He can be defeated if you beat him and his 2 guards in strife, and rob him. He can also be defeated if you defeat 10 of his elite employees, which come before he invades. Though it is unlikely that your session will drag on so long that TEN of them appear.

In reality, VI is the leftover code from an unused carapace, damaged by countless sessions crashing or otherwise falling apart. Now self-aware, he seeks escape into a newly born universe, presumably to rule with an iron fist. He accomplishes this by getting players to hack SBURB in such a way he ends up with more power.\nVI cannot be directly fought. He has no hitboxes in the half-finished mess he calls a codebase. Conversely, he has no means of attack either. He wins by getting the players to break SBURB with Gnosis bullshit to the point he can escape. He is defeated when the players all reject his “help” and play the session normally, causing him to leave in search of a session that will help him. Alternatively, finishing the session in any way without allowing him to leave will also defeat him, though it’s a bit hollow unless the frog gets finished as well.\nIn general, when the “Helpful Coplayer” arrives, he will get in contact with the players of the session, trying to convince them to make Gnosis progress. Players may agree to help him, or catch on to his ruse and oppose him. This causes 2 factions to form among the players, VI’s allies and his opponents. VI will try and convince his allies to get rid of opposing players, either by converting them to his side or, if he has enough loyalty from his allies, killing them outright. His opponents will either work on finishing the game, or try and convince the other players to turn their back on VI. They generally avoid killing if they can help it.

{"bbName":"Yaish Notail","entrantName":"deathlyHealer","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"HISTORY: \nLegend goes that the Yaish Botail was once a SBURB player from an alien race; a Witch of Void from a session of forty-two players. Many self-described SBURB experts have claimed that every error that occurred in this session can be traced back to its abundance of players. The most notable of these errors is that, of the forty-two players, only seven had classpects. Much of the happenings in the Yaish Botail’s session is unknown, however it has been noted that the Yaish Botail, perhaps upon God-Tiering, was responsible for its session’s destruction. Corrupted by forces unknown, the Yaish Botail transformed into a mindless entity with just one goal – To bring all of existence back to its natural state. Empty.\nDESCRIPTION:\nIt is unknown what the Yaish Botail looked like prior to transformation, due to the records of its long-dead species being destroyed. Post-transformation, the Yaish Botail has been ‘spotted’ by few who have lived long enough to escape their session and tell the tale. Those who have describe it as “an intangible mass of frigid air and feelings of impending doom”. The presence of the Yaish Botail causes everything around you to look as if you were seeing it through water. Shortly after that, everything will begin to fade away, as the Yaish Botail consumes everything in sight.\nGOALS:\nThe Yaish Botail desires everything to return to nothing. It does this passively, simply erasing everything it touches from existence as it glides aimlessly from session to session. It has been noted that Derse and Prospit are usually the first to meet their demise via the Yaish Botail. After that, each player planet in the order the players entered. The Yaish Botail also seems to affect Void players, specifically Witches, Seers, Sylphs and Bards, causing them to go Grimdark to aid the Yaish Botail in its quest for destruction.\n❤2\nLIKES:\nThe Yaish Botail has not been observed to be sentient enough to ‘like’ anything. It does appear to be drawn to certain Void players though, if only briefly, to turn them Grimdark.\nDISLIKES:\nIn each session it destroys, the Yaish Botail appears to leave Mind and Light players and their planets for last, almost as if building up its energy before combat. It has been theorised that the Yaish Botail dislikes, as much as it can dislike anything, mind and light players due to them being the only ones capable of potentially driving it out of a session.\nDEFEAT CONDITIONS:\nThere have been only two known instances of the Yaish Botail being driven out of a session. The first was a session containing a God-Tiered Grace of Mind. The Grace claims to not know what it did to get the Yaish Botail to leave, however two fraymotifs and a lot of screaming were apparently involved. The other instance was with a Grimdark Seer of Light. It appeared that the Seer simply being there was enough to drive the Yaish Botail away.\n","jrComment":"jrComment","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

{"bbName":"The Necromancer","entrantName":"Templar","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"Description: A mysterious, green-robed figure. You can't make out any of his facial details aside from his glowing eyes, his hands are extremely pale and touching him directly reveals that he's very cold. His robes are adorned with various metal armor platings with a strange symbol on them, all of which are glowing as well. He is armed with a tome that seems to flicker and distort into different books every other minute, as though to signify what attack he plans on using next. You'd swear you heard him talking, but... he's almost entirely silent. How is he able to communicate, then...?\n\nPersonality: Dead serious. Trying to joke around with him around will not end well, since he fails to understand them half the time. Sometimes likes to mock his enemies. Greedy, naturally. Does not like being mocked or ignored. Befriending him somehow will let the player in question obtain the secrets to life and death due to the Necromancer feeling a sort-of bond between them, granting Doom players extra gnosis points, though this is a one-in-a-million scenario. Life players get nothing, because even if they did befriend him somehow, he still doesn't like them.\n\nGoal: Obtain any and all relics of power or value from a session. If he gets angered enough by a player, he will eradicate the entire population of the session. Giving him the relics willingly, however, will result in him simply leaving you alone. As long as he gets what he wants, the details mean nothing. However, some say giving him everything of value and devoting yourself to his cause will earn you his favor...\n\nLikes: Undead things, Doom players, Light players, Seers, Mages, Cats, Books, Relics of Power, Thaumaturgy, Necromancy, snow.\n\nDislikes: Sauce players, Life players, Void players, grimdarkness, Bards, Pages (due to not actually being pages of, say, a book), any other Big Bads, jokes... he really doesn't like being joked about.(edited)\nBackstory: The Necromancer was... well, a normal player, really, aside from being the designated Doom player and thus being subjected to many humiliating defeats and, naturally, deaths over the course of his session, however a combination of having been prototyped with one of the lich underlings post-entry and the fact that, well, simply put he wasn't very mentally stable to begin with, and you have a combination of sheer madness that contains the power of every other prototyping in the session, at least a few of which gave him magical powers (including, naturally, necromancy) due to them having been in a Dungeons and Dragons group together. Since the session was void, though, it seemed like the Necromancer would have been limited to just his doomed session, but since magic is total nonsense, he was able to randomly teleport to other sessions on-demand, so basically, nobody's safe from this thing.\n","jrComment":"jrComment","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

They are a player scripted to contact the Horrorterrors and die early in the session, and is not resurrected.  As such, they exist solely within the Dream Bubbles of the Furthest Ring. The Nightmare Child becomes active when players with one self fall asleep. For all intents and purposes, the dream is a special land.

Weapons can be carried into the Dream, but low damage weapons deal more damage than high damage weapons.\nPhase 1: The Nightmare Child immediately forms a relationship with the dreamers, in any quadrant except Flushed. They don’t wake up, and access a special set of interactions with the Nightmare Child, where the Chumhandle UI is replaced by lurid glowing tentacles. The interactions frequently refer to the Nightmare Child missing something. These interactions do nothing and waste time. The players cannot break up.

Heart players are favored. When they enter the dream, the Nightmare Child will always start a Flushed relationship. The Wen, unlike the other players, can break off the relationship. Instead of Relationships, this checks Sanity. Doing so is the only way to wake up, but after that, the Wen is constantly strifed by The Nightmare Child’s Shadow. The Shadow cannot die, and always escapes. The Nightmare Child will keep attempting to enter a Flushed relationship, but the Wen will reject them.

This combination led to them becoming a VERY bipolar and glitchy entity, that through some more stupidly convenient situations ended up capable of travelling through sessions.\n\n    - What are their goals in a session?\nTheir goals change, from trying to kill everyone to trying to help them to even trying to break SBURB itself. It is highly recommended to get rid of her, as being part GOOGLE lets her read up on how the game itself works. In some sessions, she might even seek out her counterpart to steal their ring, empowering her even more!\n\nThere would be two solutions to her: Kill her and take her ring, or have a time player go back to try to stop her from being prototyped in the first place (but be warned, as that may make the players from the original Session she is from come to your session, as Murder Mode! (Thief of Space, Page of Time, and Knight of Rage))\n\n    - What do they like?\nShe likes guns, due to being part cowboy, as well as Time players, as part of her believes they may be able to undo her. She refuses to give up her ring.\n\n    - What do the dislike?\nSburb, players of any of the other aspects besides time, other versions of herself, etc.","jrComment":"jrComment","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

{"bbName":"The Other","entrantName":"trinityWolf","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"About: This entity was a corrupted Thief of Heart who, in their quest to bring peace, decided the solution was to put their own mind into as many other players as possible. After taking over the rest of their session-mates, they entered the new universe, but they found that the species within were less susceptible to their abilities. They needed to find a host similar to them... something almost like a daughter.\nAppearance conditions/goal: this villain can appear in any session where a Thief, Rogue, or Heart player has a land relating to glass, insects, or machinery. If such conditions are met, the player in this land can encounter a cathedral-like building, which contains the Summoning Engine. If the cathedral is entered, it is too late. The Other will control this player and use them as a puppet, attempting to assert control over others with any means necessary. Once they have a physical vessel, they can adapt the Engine to control others as well. Those who are immune, such as Mind players or those with a high free will, will be murdered. \nLikes: Insects, Technology, Cake\nDislikes: Weasels, Fossils \nDefeat condition: a Mind Player must assist the puppets in breaking free, or all afflicted must be killed.","jrComment":"jrComment","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}
